                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                Data pipelines are the series of steps performed to process 
the data into required formats/ destination sources. In 
these pipelines the output of each step will be source to 
the following steps. There are different scenarios where 
the pipelines are designed, it can be a simple batch job to 
read raw data and convert it into formatted data and saving 
into sources tables, consuming data from the upstream 
applications and perform transformations so that the 
data could be utilized by the downstream applications or 
creating visualizations using the transformed data etc.
There are three major factors that contribute to the speed 
with which the data flows in a pipeline, Throughput can 
be defined as the rate at which the data flows through 
the pipeline. Latency is defined as the time required for 
a single unit/token of data to flow through the pipeline.
Reliability is the measure completeness and accuracy. 
There are different techniques that are in place to ensure 
the data reliability like logging, auditing, validating etc.
There are some basic questions one should have before 
building a pipeline.
.What data source?
.What type of ingestion?
.How frequent should the load happen?
.How should the end data look like?
.Is the data consumed by any downstream applications 
or any visualizations are to be built on top of it?

            <p id="Data Source">
                <h2>Data Source</h2><br>
                It can be considered as the first and key layer of the design. 
It may include the data from any streaming sources, SaaS 
applications and relational databases etc.
            </p><br>
            <p id="Ingestion">
                <h2>Ingestion</h2>
                It is defined as a process to read the data from the data 
sources. We can read the data from each source using the 
API’s provided by the data sources itself. Before reading 
the data, we need to analyze the data sets to gain insight 
of the data through a process called Data Profiling, which 
is used to examine the quality and structure. The data can 
be ingested either batch ingestion or streaming ingestion. 
Batch Ingestion is a sequential processing where the set 
of data records can be extracted and processed together. 
These batch processes can be scheduled or triggered 
manually. In Stream ingestion a single record of data can 
be processed automatically from the data source as soon 
as it is created or in time windows which can be used to 
give near real time data.
This ingestion or extraction frequency depends on the 
requirement on how the subsequent application need the 
data to be loaded.

<p id="Transformation">
                <h2>Transformation</h2>
                Once the data extraction is done, we can transform the 
data into the required format of the destination system, 
which helps to analyze the data.
Destination:
A destination is a data warehouse, a database or a data 
mart to hold the data after the data is processed
